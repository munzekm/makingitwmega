        Homemade Pizza is very easy to make.
        First you can either buy dough from the store or you can make your own dough.
        Make sure you get enough dough for the amount of people you are making it
        for. You also want to buy your toppings and sauce for your pizza. The
        first pizza in the picture has pepperoni, cheese and red sauce. The second
        pizza has pesto and cheese. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prep your pizza.
        Add sauce. Add cheese. Add other toppings.
        Once oven gets tp 350 degrees you can put your pizza in.
        Let cook for around 15 minutes (This depends on if you create your own
        dough or you buy one from the store.)
        Enjoy after it looks cooked and crispy.

        Wings are always good for a fun get together or a appetizer!
        First you want to buy chicken from the store. Whether its wings or breasts
        you want to make sure you clean them very well. Next you can buy a seasoning
        or flavor you would like your wings to be. In the picture me and my roommates
        chose buffalo sauce. The sauce was made with franks red hot and butter.
        We Preheated the oven to 425 degrees. Then we cooked the wings without
        the sauce on. Make sure you cook the wings until they are fully done.
        They should cook around 40 minutes. Then take them out and spread the
        sauce or seasonal on them to enjoy.

        Stir Fry can contain many different things that you enjoy. In the Stir
        Fry above there are a variety of vegetables and rice. You want to start
        with a pan and a little bit of oil on the stove. Then add your rice. Could
        be any type of rice you would like. Then add your vegetables, I added
        edamame, carrots, broccoli, onions, and peas. You cut all the vegetables
        up to a perfect size then continue to mix until vegetables and rice are
        fried. You add any sauce you would like. I believe we added soy sauce and
        sweet and sour.

        Mac n cheese. First you want to boil water to cook the noodles. Most
        people use shells or little noodles for mac n cheese. Once water is boiling
        add the noodles until soft. Next I made homemade cheese sauce. First you
        want around 1/4 cup of butter in a pan. Then 1/4
        flour add to the pan. Next you want to slowly mix the flour with the
        butter and add 2 cups of milk. Then you c an add your cheese (whatever kind
        you want to use) and mix until cheese is melted. The mac and cheese I made
        had little pieces of crispy bacon. You can add whatever you would like.
        Mix cheese and noodles together and it will be ready to serve.
