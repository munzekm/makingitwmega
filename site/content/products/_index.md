        Homemade Pizza is very easy to make.
        First you can either buy dough from the store or you can make your own dough.
        Make sure you get enough dough for the amount of people you are making it
        for. You also want to buy your toppings and sauce for your pizza. The
        first pizza in the picture has pepperoni, cheese and red sauce. The second
        pizza has pesto and cheese. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prep your pizza.
        Add sauce. Add cheese. Add other toppings.
        Once oven gets tp 350 degrees you can put your pizza in.
        Let cook for around 15 minutes (This depends on if you create your own
        dough or you buy one from the store.)
        Enjoy after it looks cooked and crispy.

        Wings are always good for a fun get together or a appetizer!
        First you want to buy chicken from the store. Whether its wings or breasts
        you want to make sure you clean them very well. Next you can buy a seasoning
        or flavor you would like your wings to be. In the picture me and my roommates
        chose buffalo sauce. The sauce was made with franks red hot and butter.
        We Preheated the oven to 425 degrees. Then we cooked the wings without
        the sauce on. Make sure you cook the wings until they are fully done.
        They should cook around 40 minutes. Then take them out and spread the
        sauce or seasonal on them to enjoy.

        Stir Fry can contain many different things that you enjoy. In the Stir
        Fry above there are a variety of vegetables and rice. You want to start
        with a pan and a little bit of oil on the stove. Then add your rice. Could
        be any type of rice you would like. Then add your vegetables, I added
        edamame, carrots, broccoli, onions, and peas. You cut all the vegetables
        up to a perfect size then continue to mix until vegetables and rice are
        fried. You add any sauce you would like. I believe we added soy sauce and
        sweet and sour.

        Cajun Shrimp Pasta. First you want to turn on your water for your pasta
        so it can start to boil while you work on the sauce and the shrimp.
        Next for the sauce, you need 1/2 stick of butter, 1 1/4 cup of chicken
        broth, 1 1/4 cup of milk, 1 1/4 cup of whipping cream, and 1/4 flour.
        You can add old bay to your sauce, add as much as you want.
        Add them all together in a pan and stir occasionally. Keep on medium until
        it starts to get thick and bubble. Next, you want to put your shrimp on
        a pan and cook until shrimp turn pink. Once your water is done boiling,
        add you noodles and cook until noodles are soft. Then, drain your noodles,
        and mix the shrimp and sauce together. You can also add broccoli to the
        pasta for another taste.
