    I am currently a junior at Allegheny College. Coming into college,
    I was not really a big cooking person. When I moved in with my roommates, two
    of them were constantly cooking. I thought I would give it a try. Anytime
    they were cooking they would let me help. When I had to come up with a
    web site idea, I thought it would be a great idea to share my recipes that
    I have learned to make on my own!"
